# GTM_Link_Sender
Simple app that sends GoToMeeting links on local network as a Windows bat file.

I wrote this because when emailing GoToMeeting links inside of a Citrix environment users would often end up opening the link inside of citrix and prevent me from viewing their screen.
This provides a fast and simple way around that issue.

# How To Use
1. Enter the Go To Meeting Number and the computer name of the computer you wish to send to.
2. Click "Populate"
3. Choose the User you are sending the link to from the drop down box.
4. Click "Copy Help Link"

This will put a link called IT_Help on the users desktop which will launch Go To Meeting with the specified ID.
After launching the link deletes itself.
